Authoring Content for Deconst
=============================

Deconst *content authors* write the documentation that's rendered at some domain and path on the final instance. The content that makes up a deconst instance is brought together from many :term:`content repositories`, each of which contributes a single logical unit of documentation that can be maintained independently from all of the others.

The domain and subpath that host the content from a specific content repository is determined by a mapping that's managed within the :term:`control repository` associated with your Deconst instance. To add a new content repository to the instance, you or a *site coordinator* will need to add an entry to the control repository's :ref:`content mapping file <control-map>` and configure a :abbr:`CI (Continuous Integration)` build.

Once the content repository is fully configured, any changes merged into the "master" branch will automatically be live.

Adding a New Content Repository
-------------------------------

The easiest content repositories to add to a Deconst instance are:

- Written in one of the :ref:`already-supported formats <supported-formats>`.
- Hosted in a git repository on `github.com <https://github.com/>`_, public or private.

If your content repository does not meet those criteria, :ref:`integrating your content is still possible, but will likely take more work <custom-content-integration>`. If you do qualify for the easy route, add a new content repository to Deconst by:

#. **Ensure that the Deconst instance's GitHub account can access your repository.** If your repository is public, you don't have to do anything. If your repository is private, you'll need to grant the Deconst instance's GitHub account access before your build can be configured. Ask a Deconst administrator for the name of the bot account.

#. **Create a "_deconst.json" file within each content root directory.** This file tells Deconst important details about the content within this directory. Place it in the same directory as your ``conf.py`` or ``_config.yml`` files.

   The most important setting within this file is the *content ID base*. The content ID base will be used to uniquely identify the content produced from this directory within the system, so it must be unique across *all* content repositories that are published to a Deconst cluster. The easiest way to accomplish this is to set the content ID base to the content repository's GitHub URL (including the trailing slash to be consistent).

   You can specify other settings within this file as well, but they're all optional.

   * ``githubUrl``: Set this to the content repository's GitHub URL. If you do, it may be used to generate "submit an issue" or "edit on GitHub" links for your content.
   * ``githubBranch``: Target "edit on GitHub" links to modify content on a branch other than "master".
   * ``preparer``: Set this to the name of a Docker container image that contains the preparer for this content. Generally, Deconst will automatically infer the preparer to use from the contents of the directory, but you can override it explicitly here if needed. The container name must be on a whitelist that's controlled by the cluster administrators.
   * ``meta``: An object with arbitrary content that will be merged with document-specific metadata. This data will be available to :ref:`templates in the control repository <control-template>` beneath the ``meta`` key for extra customization. Check the README for the instance's control repository to see what keys have meaning for your templates.

   Here's an example of the minimum possible ``_deconst.json`` file:

   .. code-block:: json

     {
       "contentIDBase": "https://github.com/deconst/deconst-docs/"
     }

   Here's another ``_deconst.json`` example, fully populated:

   .. code-block:: json

     {
       "contentIDBase": "https://github.com/deconst/deconst-docs/",
       "githubUrl": "https://github.com/deconst/deconst-docs/",
       "preparer": "quay.io/deconst/preparer-sphinx",
       "meta": {
         "someKey": "someValue"
       }
     }

   One content repository can include many content root directories. Place a ``_deconst.json`` file within each one and Deconst will automatically prepare the content within each. Make sure that you give each directory a distinct content ID base! The easiest way to do this is to append a meaningful suffix to the GitHub repository URL for each one, like a version number:

   .. code-block:: json

     {
       "contentIDBase": "https://github.com/deconst/deconst-docs/v1/"
     }

#. **Send a pull request to the control repository to add your content repository's name to the automatic build list.** This is a file called ``content-repositories.json`` in the root directory of the control repository that looks like this:

   .. code-block:: json

     [
       { "kind": "github", "project": "deconst/deconst-docs" },
       { "kind": "github", "project": "myorg/my-content" }
     ]

   Add a new entry to the array with your project's name. Once your pull request is merged, a :term:`Strider` build will be created for your content repository, and any changes that you make to your repository from this point forward will automatically be submitted to Deconst.

At this point, your content is being sent to Deconst, but nobody can see it yet. The next step is to work with a :ref:`coordinator <site-coordinator>` to decide on a place your content should live in the context of the larger site.

Where Will Your Content Live
----------------------------

The final output from each content repository will be presented at a subpath of the complete site. For example, if you create the following pages:

.. code-block:: text

  welcome
  chapter-1/introduction
  chapter-1/getting-started
  chapter-2/more-advanced

And you're currently mapped to the ``books/example/`` subpath of *mysite.com* by the control repository, then your pages will be available at the following URLs:

.. code-block:: text

  https://mysite.com/books/example/welcome/
  https://mysite.com/books/example/chapter-1/introduction/
  https://mysite.com/books/example/chapter-1/getting-started/
  https://mysite.com/books/example/chapter-2/more-advanced/

As you work, you can freely create new pages and directories and they will automatically be available within that subpath.

.. warning::

  Currently, *deleting* pages doesn't actually remove the content from deconst. An administrator needs to remove documents from Cloud Files manually to delete content.

Content mapping is determined by :ref:`content mapping configuration files <control-map>` within the control repository. Open an issue on the control repository to discuss the addition of new content, or modify the content mapping files yourself in a pull request if you're also a site coordinator.

.. _custom-content-integration:

Custom Content Repository Integrations
--------------------------------------

While Deconst provides automation to support content repositories that satisfy the constraints listed above, it's flexible enough to accept content from virtually anywhere. You can even submit content entirely by manually using nothing but ``curl`` if you really want to. If your content repository is different, you'll need to do more work up front.

Whatever is different about your content repository, you'll need two pieces of information to begin:

* The **content service URL** for the Deconst instance. Generally, this will be port 9000 on a domain served by the instance, like ``https://deconst.horse:9000``.
* An **API key** issued for you by an administrator. While you can technically use a single key for all of your content, I recommend using a distinct key for each content repository, because it diminishes the impact of a key being revoked and makes it easier to track activity in the logs.

**If your repository is not hosted on github.com,** but is reachable from the network that the Deconst instance is running on, you'll need to create a custom Strider build. You can do this for any git-based provider by choosing the "Manual Add" option under the "Projects" tab:

.. image:: /_images/strider-manual-add.jpg

**If your repository is not reachable from the network** because it's hosted behind a firewall or **if your repository is not version controlled with git**, you'll need to configure your own continuous integration solution, like `Jenkins <https://jenkins-ci.org/>`_. You should set it up to run the appropriate :term:`preparer` on your content repository each time new work is accepted.

**If your repository is not written in a supported content format,** you'll need to write a custom :term:`preparer`. Depending on the flexibility and architecture of the tooling, the difficulty of doing this can vary from "a few days' work by a developer" to "a lot of time".

.. _supported-formats:

Supported Content Repository Formats
------------------------------------

Each content repository can independently choose a documentation engine that makes the most sense for the content it contains. You can choose from any format that has a matching :term:`preparer`. Preparers extend the native documentation engine to support additional functionality that Deconst needs to integrate their output with the rest of the system.
