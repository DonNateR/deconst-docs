Coordinating a Deconst Site
===========================

A Deconst *site coordinator* has several responsibilities, including management of the site's high-level information architecture, graphic design, and maintenance of the layouts and assets for each domain within the site.

The Control Repository
----------------------

Every deconst installation is configured to point to a single **control repository**, a version-controlled repository that's used to manage site-wide concerns. It's a GitHub repository containing mostly plain-text files that you can edit however you wish, even directly with GitHub's web editor!

While changes to assets will go live automatically after a short delay, changes to content or template mappings requires administrator action to take effect.

The control repository is expected to include certain contents:

 * At least one :ref:`content mapping file <control-map>` that tells Deconst which content to display where.
 * :ref:`Templates <control-template>` that give individual pages visual identity.
 * :ref:`Template mapping files <control-template-map>` that specify which template should be used to render a specific page.
 * :ref:`Global assets <control-template-assets>` such as stylesheets, JavaScript files, or images that are referenced by the layout templates.
