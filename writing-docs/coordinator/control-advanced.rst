Content IDs
^^^^^^^^^^^

Strictly speaking, the way that :term:`content IDs` are assigned is an
arbitrary decision made by the :term:`preparer` that's configured on
that repository. However, by convention, they follow a pattern:

  *base URL of the content repository* + *subpath of the rendered page*

For example, suppose that we have a content repository hosted at
https://github.com/deconst/deconst-docs that contains Sphinx
documentation. A page within that repository that renders at
*writing-docs/coordinator* would be assigned a content ID of
``https://github.com/deconst/deconst-docs/writing-docs/coordinator``.
