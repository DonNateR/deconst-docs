Webhooks and Integration
------------------------

Deconst uses a combination of webhooks and continuous integration "builds" to
stay up to date with changes made to the control and content repositories.
Although it *should* manage them itself, if anything isn't updating correctly,
these are the first places you should check.

You can verify that they're installed correctly by visiting the
``settings/hooks`` page within the relevant GitHub repository.

These are the integrations that need to be installed on a **control
repository**:

 * A ``.travis.yml`` file that clones and executes the *asset preparer*. It
   should have the following contents:

   .. code-block:: yaml

      ---
      language: node_js
      node_js:
      - "0.12"
      install:
      - git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/deconst/preparer-asset.git /tmp/preparer-asset
      script:
      - /tmp/preparer-asset/build.sh

.. end the code block.

These are the integrations that need to be installed on each
**content repository**:

 * A ``.travis.yml`` file that clones and executes the appropriate
   :term:`preparer` for that repository type. Here's an example for a Sphinx
   repository:

   .. code-block:: yaml

      ---
      language: python
      python:
      - "3.4"
      install:
      - "pip install -e git+https://github.com/deconst/preparer-sphinx.git#egg=deconstrst"
      script:
      - deconst-prepare-sphinx

.. end the code block.
