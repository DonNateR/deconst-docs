# Deconst documentation

Documentation for the *deconst* project: a continuous delivery pipeline for heterogenous documentation. It's also used to develop deconst itself, like some kind of documentation ouroboros. You can read the documentation itself at [deconst.horse](https://deconst.horse/).

## Building

To build this documentation standalone, use the [Deconst client](https://github.com/deconst/client). Use the Sphinx preparer and a clone of `https://github.com/deconst/deconst-docs-control` as the control repository.
