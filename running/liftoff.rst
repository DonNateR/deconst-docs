Liftoff!
========

Before you get started, you'll need a few things:

#. A collection of servers to host your Docker containers. We use `CoreOS
   <https://coreos.com/>`_ images on Rackspace cloud.

#. `Docker <https://docs.docker.com/installation/>`_ installed on each host.
   CoreOS already has this, but different images may not.

#. Probably other things that will materialize once we have real code to ship!
