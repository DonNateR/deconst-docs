Architecture
============

Deconst is distributed as a set of Docker containers, deployed by an Ansible playbook.

This is our initial architecture:

Terminology
-----------

.. glossary::

  content repository
    Location containing material to be included as a subset of the completed site. Often, the
    material within will be written in a friendlier human-editable markup format such as
    reStructuredText or Markdown.

    Initially, we will support support content stored in git repositories on
    `GitHub <github.com>`_, although our architecture will be flexible enough to integrate
    content stored anywhere on a network reachable from the build system.

  control repository
    Version controlled repository used to organize and administer a deconst platform. It contains:

    * Plain-text documents that associate subtrees of indexed content, identified by a
      :term:`content ID` prefix, with subtrees of :term:`presented URLs` on the presented site.
    * Layout templates in `handlebars <http://handlebarsjs.com/>`_ format.
    * Plain-text documents that associate subsets of :term:`presented URLs` with specific layouts.

  content ID
    Unique identifier assigned to a single page of content generated from a :term:`content
    repository`. It's important to note that a content ID is assigned to each *output* page, not
    each source document. Depending on the :term:`preparer` and its configuration, these may differ.
    Most of the architecture should treat these as opaque strings, although the :term:`mapping
    service` may need to assume that they are hierarchal.

    By convention, these are URLs that join the base URL of the :term:`content repository` with the
    relative path of the rendered output page.

    Examples:

    * The version of this page on the default "master" branch:
      ``https://github.com/deconst/deconst-docs/running/architecture``.
    * The version of this page on a branch called "glossary":
      ``https://github.com/deconst/deconst-docs/tree/glossary/running/architecture``.
    * A specific post in a Jekyll blog, generated from (theoretical) content at
      ``https://github.com/rackerlabs/developer-blog/_posts/mongodb-3.0-getting-started.md``:
      ``https://github.com/rackerlabs/developer-blog/blog/mongodb-3.0-getting-started``.

  presented URL
  presented URLs
    URL of a page within the final presented content of a deconst site. This should be the full URL,
    including the scheme and domain.

    Example: ``https://developer.rackspace.com/sdks/cloud-servers/getting-started/``.

  layout
    Template of common markup that surrounds each presented page with navigation, brand identity,
    copyright information and anything else that's shared among some subset of each site.

Components
----------

.. glossary::

  preparer
    Process responsible for converting a :term:`content repository` into a directory tree of JSON
    documents, each of which contains one page of rendered HTML and associated metadata.

    If the current branch is live, the generated JSON documents are then submitted to the
    :term:`content service` for storage and indexing. Otherwise, a local :term:`presenter` is
    invoked to complete a full build of this subtree of the final site, which is then published to
    CDN and linked on the pull request.

    There will be one preparer for each supported format of :term:`content repository`; initially,
    Sphinx and Jekyll. The preparer will be executed by a CI/CD system on each commit to the
    repository.

  content service
    Service that accepts submissions and queries for the most recent page content associated with a
    specific :term:`content ID`. Content submitted here will have its structure validated and
    indexed.

  mapping service
    Given a :term:`presented URL`, return the corresponding :term:`content ID`, or an alternate
    destination to use as a redirect target. Uses the latest version of the :term:`control
    repository` as a source of truth for performing the association.

  presenter
    Accept HTTP requests from users. Map the requested :term:`presented URL` to :term:`content ID`
    by querying the :term:`mapping service`, then access the requested content using the
    :term:`content service`. Inject the content into an approriate :term:`layout` and send the
    final HTML back in an HTTP response.
