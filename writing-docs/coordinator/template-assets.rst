Assets
------

Raw HTML isn't very exciting on its own. To make a site look good and behave sensibly, you'll need to include assets: CSS, JavaScript, images and possibly fonts. Deconst control repositories use a `Grunt <http://gruntjs.com/>`_ plugin to implement an asset pipeline. Grunt's configuration determines the layout and capabilities of the pipeline for any specific deployment, so consult your repository's README for more information.
